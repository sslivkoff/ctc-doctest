## Rough Plan
- go through old notes on meeting with rari where talked about ctc on high level
- look at docs of other projects for inspiration
    - https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

## Url
- make docs take the URL `checkthechain.github.io/docs`
    - can do this one of two ways
        - make as repo named `checkthechain.github.io`, put docs stuff in `/docs` folder
        - make repo named `docs`
- eventually transfer this to `ctc.xyz`
