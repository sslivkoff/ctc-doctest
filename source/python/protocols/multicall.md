# Multicall

## Examples

```{admonition} Note
These examples are crafted as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). You can download the original notebook file [here](https://github.com/sslivkoff/ctc-doctest/blob/main/source/python/notebooks/protocols/multicall.ipynb).
</br>
</br>
Also note that inside Jupyter notebooks, `await` can be used freely outside of `asyncio.run()`.
