# Useful Aliases

`ctc` makes it simple to perform many tasks from the command line. However, `ctc` can be made even more simple by using shell aliases that reduce the number of required keystrokes that must be typed.

The `ctc` codebase includes an optional set of cli aliases for this purpose. These aliases can be found in [a script](https://github.com/fei-protocol/checkthechain/blob/main/scripts/ctc_aliases.sh) in the repo, but they are also pasted below for convenience.

These aliases make it so you do not need to type the `"ctc"` before a subcommand name. For example, instead of typing `ctc keccak <address>`, you just type `keccak <address>`. Instead of typing `ctc 4byte <query>`, you just type `4byte <query>`. And so on, for many different `ctc` subcommands.

To use these aliases, you need to include them in your shell config file (e.g. `~/.profile`). You can either copy paste the alias commands directly, or you can add a single line: `source <PATH_TO_ALIAS_FILE>`.
