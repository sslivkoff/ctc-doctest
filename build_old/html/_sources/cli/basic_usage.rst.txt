Basic Usage
===========

The ``ctc`` cli command performs operations related to processing EVM data, especially operations related to historical data analysis. Many different EVM datasets can be generated by individual calls to ``ctc``.

Typical usage is ``ctc <subcommand> [options]``, using `Subcommands <./subcommands.html>`_.

Most of the cli documentation pages are copied from ``ctc``'s in-terminal help messages.
